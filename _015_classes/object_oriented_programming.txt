-> What is OOP?
    - OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
    - Object-oriented programming is about creating 'objects', which can hold data and functions that work on the data.

-> Advantages of OOP
    - OOP provides a clear structure to programs.
    - Makes code easier to maintain, reuse and debug.
    - Helps keep our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    - Makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.
Note: DRY principle means we should avoid writing the same code more than once. We should move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.

-> What are classes and objects?
    - Classes and objects are the two main aspects of OOP.
    - A cass defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class.
        Example:
        Class               Objects
        Fruits              Apple, Banana, Mango
        Car                 Volvo, Audi, Toyota
    - When we create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.

-> Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming
    - Procedural Programming is about writing functions that operate on data.
    - Object-oriented Programming (OOP) is about creating objects that contain both the data and the functions.
    - In procedural programming, the code is organized around functions.
    - In object-oriented programming, the code is organized around objects.
